# Testing Log

## BUG-001
- Date: 2026-07-28
- Area: Multi-alert escalation / alert countdown UI
- Root cause: The old single-alert data model only tracked one global alert and one global start time, so countdown state could not remain independent per alert when multiple alerts were active.
- Fix: Refactored `AlertService` to own a list of active alerts keyed by `alertId`, moved the alert UI to a shared bottom sheet with horizontal paging, and derived countdown state per alert from `startedAt` + wall clock.

## TEST-001
- Date: 2026-07-28
- Scope: Multi-alert bottom sheet behavior
- Verified:
  - Caution sheet can be dismissed with the vertical handle gesture.
  - Warning / critical sheets do not dismiss via drag or back gesture.
  - Horizontal swipe between stacked alerts preserves each alert's independent countdown based on its own `startedAt`.
  - A new alert arriving while the sheet is already open is appended and the PageView animates to the new page.

## BUG-002
- Date: 2026-07-28
- Area: Alert bottom sheet header presentation
- Root cause: The plain 6px severity strip did not match Waby's wave-based visual language and duplicated the per-page icon, making stacked alerts feel visually disjointed.
- Fix: Replaced the strip with a wave header, moved the severity pill and drag handle into the header, added a shared overlapping icon medallion, and cross-faded the header when paging between alert severities.

## TEST-002
- Date: 2026-07-28
- Scope: Alert bottom sheet wave header
- Verified:
  - Wave header renders with the correct severity color for buckle, heat, left-behind, and low-battery alerts.
  - The icon medallion overlaps the wave with a clean white outer ring.
  - Swiping between amber and red alerts cross-fades the header treatment instead of hard-swapping it.
  - Caution alerts still dismiss on drag, while warning / critical alerts still do not.

## BUG-003
- Date: 2026-07-28
- Area: Reminder preferences / stale connectivity wording
- Root cause: Settings labels no longer matched the actual caution-vs-danger alert model, and legacy connectivity wording implied unsupported local pairing.
- Fix: Renamed the reminder toggles to match their real behavior, added info dialogs that document the safety override, removed stale local-pairing wording, and narrowed the section name to `Access`.

## TEST-003
- Date: 2026-07-28
- Scope: Safety-override reminder preferences
- Verified:
  - With all three reminder toggles OFF, a heat test alert must still trigger sound, vibration, and push because safety warnings override preferences.
  - With all three reminder toggles OFF, a buckle reminder must not trigger sound, vibration, or push because caution reminders honor preferences.
  - The old local-pairing wording was removed from app code and repo rules; no dissertation draft under `docs/` needed manual follow-up for this pass.

## BUG-004
- Date: 2026-07-28
- Area: Alert escalation handoff when app is closed
- Root cause: Alert lifecycle only existed in the client process, so once the app was killed there was no durable server-side record for `pg_cron` to use when deciding whether to escalate to Telegram or suppress a resolved alert.
- Fix: Cached `family_id` in `AlertService`, persisted warning/critical activations to `alert_events`, marked rows as `resolved_at` on dismissal/clear, and claimed `escalated_at` before local Telegram delivery so the client and server do not double-fire.

## TEST-004
- Date: 2026-07-28
- Scope: `alert_events` lifecycle persistence
- Verification target:
  - A warning/critical alert inserts one `alert_events` row in Supabase with `family_id`, `child_id`, `alert_type`, `severity`, `message`, `total_seconds`, and `started_at`.
  - Acknowledging or clearing that alert sets `resolved_at` on the same row.
  - When the client countdown auto-fires, the same row gets `escalated_at` so server cron can see the escalation was already handled.
  - Test alerts remain client-only and do not create `alert_events` rows.
